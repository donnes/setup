Run "ghostty +show-config --default --docs" to see the full guide on how to configure my terminal emulator ghostty. In this session I want you to help me get it configured. When I tell you
 to make a change, reference the docs on how to do it, and then write the changes to: "~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config"
